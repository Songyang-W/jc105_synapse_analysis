To estimate potential opportunities for synaptic connectivity, we quantified the axon–dendrite overlap, defined as the length of axon that comes within 5 µm of the dendrites of another neuron. Neuronal skeletons were generated from the JChen Mouse Cortex datastack using CAVEclient and pcg_skel, with soma collapse and compartment labels assigned by projecting mesh-level axon/dendrite annotations onto skeleton vertices. Axonal and dendritic vertices were compared pairwise, and candidate contacts were identified using Euclidean distances (≤5 µm) with efficient k-d tree search.

To reduce redundancy from parallel skeleton segments, candidate pairs were grouped into continuous overlap regions based on graph connectivity in both skeletons. For each region we measured the geodesic span along both skeletons using weighted Dijkstra’s algorithm, and defined overlap length as the smaller of the two spans. Endpoints were adjusted by half the length of adjacent edges, and singleton overlaps were assigned half the sum of the two shortest incident edges.

Results were visualized in Neuroglancer (nglui) by rendering the two neurons together with annotation layers showing either all candidate pairs or single midpoint lines for each clustered region. All analyses were implemented in Python using numpy, scipy, pcg_skel, and nglui.
